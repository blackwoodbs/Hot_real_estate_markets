    "    Being able to identifiy emerging real estate markets early could potentially lead to great investment opertunities. Houseing volume data was best suited for this as a leading indicator. \n",

    "    The data was collected from https://www.zillow.com/research/data/. It contains number of condo units sold per month in 95 different Metropolitan areas. Time series modeling was choosen to be the most appropriate method to make predictions using the data. To compare different areas it was important to establish baseline parameters, this was done using the 'United States' regional data. Each region was then modeled and a slope of the predictios was taken to rank the regions. A higher slope represents a stronger positive trend in volume. A mean percent error was taken as a method to validate the data. Scaling of the data was determined to be appropriate given comparisons between volume of regions were significantly different. Future trends were then forcasted and ranked based on a 2 year slope. Top and bottom rankings were then visualized and compared between the models. \n",
